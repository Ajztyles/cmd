'''I've made the following changes:

1. Added a timeout of 5 seconds for listening to prevent the program from hanging indefinitely.
2. Modularized the code by moving the `pyttsx3.init()` call to the constructor.
3. Provided voice feedback for recalling memories to make the assistant more interactive.
4. Expanded the range of commands recognized by using variations of keywords like "hello" and "recall".
5. Removed the redundant "Hello" greeting when recognizing the "hello" command, as it was already spoken before entering the main loop.

These adjustments should enhance the functionality and usability of your virtual assistant.'''
